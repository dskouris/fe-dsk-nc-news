# NC News Front-end (fe-nc-news)

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

It allows you see a range of articles, filter them by topics and sort by the number of votes, comments and creation date, on the basis of being logged in as a default user.

The site includes the ability to comment and vote on articles and comments. You can also delete your own comments if you choose.

The site was completed using a combination of React JS for the front end and Node/Express with PostgreSQL for the back end server and is fully mobile responsive.
